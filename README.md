# ArtsEngine
3D and voxel engine using a combination of OCaml, C++, and Python | https://chatgpt.com/share/66ec49be-7e98-8009-a8ff-d2097d6f7738
# ArtsEngine - 3D & Voxel Art Rendering Engine
ArtsEngine is an open-source, multi-language engine designed to analyze, simulate, and render various art forms, including textures, 3D models, music tracks, MIDI, and more. The engine combines C++, OCaml, and Python to provide a dynamic environment for real-time 3D and voxel graphics, audio synchronization, and live scene composition.

Features
3D & Voxel Rendering: Real-time rendering engine built using C++ and OpenGL (or Vulkan/DirectX).
Scene Composition: Compose and simulate scenes, chaining models, textures, and music in a timeline-based environment.
Music and MIDI Synchronization: Integrate MIDI and audio files into scenes, allowing for interactive and synchronized experiences.
Cross-Language Integration: Combines the strengths of C++, OCaml, and Python for high-performance rendering, logic handling, and flexible scripting.

Prerequisites
Before building and running ArtsEngine, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

C++ Engine (Rendering and Core Logic)
C++ Compiler (GCC, Clang, MSVC)
OpenGL/Vulkan/DirectX (Depending on your choice of graphics API)
GLFW or SDL2 (For window management and input handling)
CMake (For building the C++ project)
OCaml (Scene Composition and Logic)
OCaml (via OPAM, the OCaml package manager)
Oasis (For managing OCaml dependencies and building)
Python (UI and Scripting)
Python 3.x
PyQt5 or Tkinter (For building the timeline UI)
Pip (Python package manager)
Building the Project
C++ (Rendering Engine)
Install Required Libraries:

GLFW or SDL2
OpenGL development libraries
Compile the C++ Code:

bash
Copy code
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
This will build the core engine and generate an executable.

OCaml (Scene Logic)
Set Up OCaml:

bash
Copy code
opam init
opam install ocamlbuild
Build the OCaml Components:

Navigate to the src/ocaml/ directory and build the OCaml logic:

bash
Copy code
cd src/ocaml
ocamlbuild scene.ml
Python (Timeline Interface)
Install Python Dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install PyQt5
Run the Timeline UI:

Navigate to src/python/ and run the timeline interface:

bash
Copy code
python timeline.py
Running the Engine
Once the project is built, you can run the engine from the command line:

bash
Copy code
./ArtsEngine
The engine will load default assets (models, textures, and audio) from the assets/ directory. You can use the Python-based UI to modify scenes and synchronize music or MIDI tracks with live-rendered visuals.

Future Features and Roadmap
Add support for advanced shaders and real-time lighting.
Implement full timeline functionality with drag-and-drop scene elements.
Integrate more audio formats and deeper synchronization with MIDI.
Build more example scenes and assets for testing.
