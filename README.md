# ArtsEngine
3D and voxel engine using a combination of OCaml, C++, and Python | https://chatgpt.com/share/66ec49be-7e98-8009-a8ff-d2097d6f7738
Step 1: Define the Project Scope and Plan
Before writing any code, let's solidify what the core functionality of your engine will be. You can break it down into several modules:

Rendering Engine (C++/OpenGL/Vulkan/DirectX):

3D/voxel rendering.
Texture and model handling.
Scene graph system for placing objects in space.
Audio Engine (C++/Python):

Integration for music tracks, MIDI playback, and synchronization with scenes.
Scene Composition and Logic (OCaml):

Scene and timeline description DSL.
Mechanisms to synchronize models, textures, and music over time.
User Interface (Python):

Timeline interface for configuring scenes and elements.
Scriptable interface for modifying and automating workflows.
Integration and Cross-Language Communication:

C++ will act as the core engine, while OCaml handles logic and Python manages UI/automation. We need to set up cross-language bindings.
Step 2: Set Up Your GitHub Repository
Create a GitHub Account (if not already done):

Visit GitHub and create an account if you don’t already have one.
Create a New Repository:

Go to your profile, click on Repositories, and click New.
Name your repository (something like ArtsEngine or VoxelArtEngine).
Choose public visibility for open-source.
Add a README file, a .gitignore (for C++, OCaml, and Python), and a license (MIT License is commonly used for open-source projects).
Clone the Repository Locally:

Clone the repository to your local machine:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ArtsEngine.git
cd ArtsEngine
Basic Directory Structure: Set up a simple structure for your project, with folders for each language and component:

bash
Copy code
ArtsEngine/
├── src/
│   ├── engine/         # C++ core engine code
│   ├── ocaml/          # OCaml logic and scene composition
│   └── python/         # Python UI and scripting interface
├── assets/             # Folder for textures, models, music tracks
├── tests/              # Unit tests for various components
├── README.md           # Project description and instructions
├── LICENSE             # Open-source license
└── .gitignore          # To exclude build files, logs, etc.
Push the Initial Directory to GitHub:

bash
Copy code
git add .
git commit -m "Initial project structure"
git push origin main
Step 3: Start with the C++ Core Engine
Begin by setting up a basic 3D/voxel rendering engine using C++. We’ll use OpenGL as an example here:

Install OpenGL:

Install development libraries for OpenGL and a windowing library like GLFW or SDL2.
Create a Simple Rendering Loop: Start with a basic OpenGL rendering loop in C++. Here’s an example:

cpp
Copy code
// src/engine/main.cpp
#include <GLFW/glfw3.h>

int main() {
    if (!glfwInit()) return -1;

    GLFWwindow* window = glfwCreateWindow(640, 480, "Hello OpenGL", NULL, NULL);
    if (!window) {
        glfwTerminate();
        return -1;
    }

    glfwMakeContextCurrent(window);

    while (!glfwWindowShouldClose(window)) {
        glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);

        // Render scene here...

        glfwSwapBuffers(window);
        glfwPollEvents();
    }

    glfwDestroyWindow(window);
    glfwTerminate();
    return 0;
}
Compile the C++ Code: Write a CMakeLists.txt file to compile the C++ code.

bash
Copy code
# CMakeLists.txt
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(ArtsEngine)

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 11)

add_executable(ArtsEngine src/engine/main.cpp)

find_package(OpenGL REQUIRED)
find_package(glfw3 REQUIRED)

target_link_libraries(ArtsEngine OpenGL::GL glfw)
To build:

bash
Copy code
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
Push Your Changes to GitHub:

bash
Copy code
git add .
git commit -m "Add basic OpenGL rendering loop"
git push origin main
Step 4: OCaml Scene Composition and Timeline Logic
Next, you can start setting up the OCaml components for scene composition and handling timelines:

Set Up OCaml:

Install OCaml and OPAM (the OCaml package manager).
Create a basic OCaml program that can read a scene description (in a DSL) and output commands for the C++ engine to render.
Example OCaml Scene DSL:

ocaml
Copy code
(* src/ocaml/scene.ml *)
type object3d = 
  | Cube of float  (* Size *)
  | Sphere of float  (* Radius *)

let render_scene objects = 
  List.iter (fun obj -> 
    match obj with 
    | Cube size -> Printf.printf "Render Cube with size %f\n" size
    | Sphere radius -> Printf.printf "Render Sphere with radius %f\n" radius
  ) objects

(* Test with: *)
let () = 
  render_scene [Cube 1.0; Sphere 0.5]
Push Your OCaml Code to GitHub.

Step 5: Python UI and Timeline Interface
Use Python to create the timeline interface and scriptable logic. You can start with PyQt5 or Tkinter to build the interface.

Install PyQt5:

bash
Copy code
pip install PyQt5
Basic Timeline Interface: Create a basic timeline interface to control objects and scenes.

python
Copy code
# src/python/timeline.py
from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication, QMainWindow, QLabel

app = QApplication([])
window = QMainWindow()
window.setWindowTitle("Timeline Interface")

label = QLabel("Timeline Controls Here", window)
label.move(50, 50)

window.show()
app.exec_()
Step 6: Cross-Language Integration
Use Python bindings (pybind11 or Boost.Python) to allow Python to communicate with C++. You can also use OCaml’s ctypes to bind the OCaml logic with C++.

Step 7: Make it Open Source Ready
Document Your Project:

Add detailed instructions in the README.md file for how to set up, build, and run your project.
Include contribution guidelines for open-source contributors.
Add Unit Tests:

Set up a testing framework for each language (GoogleTest for C++, OUnit for OCaml, unittest for Python).
License:

Include an open-source license like MIT to specify usage rights.
Step 8: Engage the Open-Source Community
Write a clear CONTRIBUTING.md guide to explain how others can contribute.
Create issues and roadmap tasks so others can help with development.
Once you’ve got your basic engine up and running and your GitHub repo is set up, feel free to share the link, and I can help you further refine the project, write documentation, or help with features like texture loading, timeline UI, or MIDI integration.
